# DATABASE EXPLORATION
To understand the structure of the database, I visualise the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that maps out the tables and their connections. I then proceed to understanding the dimensions and measures in the tables, which sets the foundation of unlimited exploratory of the dataset

Purpose:
    - To explore the structure of the database, including the list of tables and their schemas.
    - To inspect the columns and metadata for specific tables.

select *
from gold.dim_customers;

select *
from gold.dim_products;

select DISTINCT category
from gold.dim_products;

select *
from gold.fact_sales;

--Explore All Objects in the Database
SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES

------Explore All Columns in the Database
SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'dim_customers'

SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'dim_products'

SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'fact_sales'

# DATABASE EXPLORATION
To understand the structure of the database, I visualise the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that maps out the tables and their connections. I then proceed to understanding the dimensions and measures in the tables, which sets the foundation of unlimited exploratory of the dataset

Purpose:
    - To explore the structure of the database, including the list of tables and their schemas.
    - To inspect the columns and metadata for specific tables.

Table Used:
    - INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
    - INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
